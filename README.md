# Pythontodo
A basic to-do list project
This to-do list application is a simple command-line program written in Python that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, view the list of current tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The application persists tasks between sessions by saving them to a text file.

Features
1. Add Task: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list. Each task is stored with a status indicating whether it is completed or pending.
2. Delete Task: Users can delete tasks from their to-do list by specifying the task number.
3. View Tasks: Users can view all tasks in their to-do list, along with their status (completed or pending).
4. Check Off Task: Users can mark tasks as completed by specifying the task number.
